Code will be released soon.

### Introduction
This repository is for our PG 2018 paper 'Non-Local Low-Rank Normal Filtering for Mesh Denoising'. In this paper, we present a non-local low-rank normal filtering method for mesh denoising. By exploring the geometric similarity between local surface patches on 3D meshes in the form of normal fields, we devise a low-rank recovery model that filters normal vectors by means of patch groups.

In this repository, we release demo (exe files), code (C++), and data.
